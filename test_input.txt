Neural Network Steganography Test Payload
==========================================

This file serves as a test input for the neural network steganography framework.
It contains approximately 512 bytes of text data that will be embedded into the
ResNet-18 model weights.

The steganography system will:
1. Convert this text into binary bits
2. Analyze layer sensitivity in the neural network
3. Select the least sensitive weights for embedding
4. Perturb those weights to encode the secret message
5. Maintain model accuracy within 1.5% threshold

This payload will be tested against various attacks including:
- Fine-tuning attacks (5 and 10 epochs)
- Structured pruning (30%, 50%, 60%)
- Quantization attacks
- FGSM adversarial attacks
- PGD adversarial attacks

Expected survival rates should be above 70% for most attacks.
